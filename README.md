Key Features
Multi-Level Sorting:

Implemented merge sort to organize data by Product ID, Issue Codes, and Timestamp (down to the minute). Ensured each sorting step achieved an optimal time complexity of O(n log n).
Linked List Integration:

Designed a single linked list to consolidate data from multiple production lines, enabling seamless traversal and streamlined data processing.
Search Algorithms:

Developed binary search algorithms to locate the earliest occurrences of specific Product ID and Issue Code pairs efficiently.
Integrated linear search for frequency counts across all production lines, ensuring flexibility for non-sorted data operations.
Insights and Metrics:

Automated the tracking of issue frequencies per product across all lines, presented in a clear tabular format for easy analysis.
