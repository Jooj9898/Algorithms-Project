# 🛠️ Production Line Data Processor

A robust system designed to analyze and process production line data with high efficiency. This project showcases my expertise in algorithms, data structures, and optimization, all implemented in **C**.

## 🔑 **Key Features**

### 🌀 **Multi-Level Sorting**
- **Merge Sort** implementation to organize data by:
  1. **Product ID**
  2. **Issue Codes**
  3. **Timestamps** (down to the minute).
- Achieved an optimal time complexity of **O(n log n)** for each sorting step.

### 🔗 **Linked List Integration**
- Designed a **single linked list** to:
  - Consolidate data from multiple production lines.
  - Enable seamless traversal and streamlined data processing.

### 🔍 **Search Algorithms**
- **Binary Search**:
  - Efficiently locate the earliest occurrences of specific **Product ID** and **Issue Code** pairs in sorted data.
- **Linear Search**:
  - Integrated for frequency counts across all production lines.
  - Ensured flexibility for operations on non-sorted data.

### 📊 **Insights and Metrics**
- Automated tracking of **issue frequencies** per product across all lines.
- Presented metrics in a clear, **tabular format** for straightforward analysis.
